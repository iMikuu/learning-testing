          <p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric 
vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean 
energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>

        <h4 id="cars" class="head4">Cars</h4><br>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: Lobster, monospace;">Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. 
          From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – <a href="https://www.tesla.com/models" target="_blank">Model S</a> – which has become the best car in its class in every category. 
          Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. 
          In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with <a href="https://www.tesla.com/modelx" target="_blank">Model X</a>, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
          Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me" target="_blank">Secret Master Plan</a>,” in 2016, Tesla introduced <a href="https://www.tesla.com/model3" target="_blank">Model 3</a>, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. 
          Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – <a href="https://www.tesla.com/semi" target="_blank">Tesla Semi</a> – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. 
          In 2019, Tesla unveiled <a href="https://www.tesla.com/modely" target="_blank">Model Y</a>, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck" target="_blank">Cybertruck</a>, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.</p>
        <h4 id="solar" class="head4">Solar roof</h4>
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; font-family: Lobster, monospace; margin-top:0.8em;"><a href="https://www.tesla.com/solarroof">Solar Roof</a> brings your roof to life with beautiful tiles that can power your home with clean energy for decades. Created for maximum durability and designed to integrate directly into your home, Solar Roof can help pay for itself over time with the energy you produce.
          Every Solar Roof system is bundled with Powerwall, a compact home battery that can store energy produced with solar, making it available anytime. You can use this power at night when the sun isn’t shining and keep your home running off of your clean energy. Powerwall also detects outages automatically, allowing you to keep your lights on and phones charged when the grid goes down.
          Tesla Solar Roof is designed to maximize your roof’s energy production without compromising the aesthetics of your home. Solar Roof is constructed with a combination of glass solar tiles, glass roofing tiles and architectural-grade steel tiles. Each tile is virtually indistinguishable in color and trim. Solar Roof is built to enhance your home’s design and looks incredible from any angle.
          Solar Roof is a premium roof with the added benefit of solar production. Solar Roof tiles are engineered for all-weather durability, ensuring your home stays protected even in extreme conditions.
          Since Solar Roof has a smaller footprint than traditional solar panels, Tesla may be able to add more solar to your roof – working around vents, skylights or other obstructions. This helps maximize the amount of solar energy your roof can produce. Control your system with 24/7 mobile monitoring from anywhere in the world.
          Tesla Solar Roof is the only roof on the market that can help pay for itself over time. Take control of your monthly electric bill by using the energy produced by your solar system to power your home.
