<strong>Q. How will I know if I'm selected to participate in the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta?</strong> 
<br>
A. Players selected to participate in the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta will receive a welcome email from the Overwatch team with instructions on how to gain access to the build. Starting at 11am, we will begin rolling out beta access to selected participants. While players selected initially should all receive access on the first day, we may extend invitations to more players at later periods in this test.

      <br>
<strong>Q. How can I opt-in to the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta and how are players selected?</strong><br>
A. Visit the Overwatch 2 PvP Beta page to opt-in for the beta. You can learn more about whatâ€™s included in the PvP Beta and sign up for beta testing! <br>  
      <br>

<strong>Q. Do I need an Overwatch license to play in the beta?</strong><br>

      <br>

<strong>Q. Will there be any other ways to get into the PvP Beta besides opting-in?</strong><br>
